# K-means-shiny-app-from-scratch
A small project I created to illustrate the K-means algorithm (built from scratch in R), interactively. You can change K to see the effect of the data tagging and watch it in 2D or 3D.

You can see the full project here: https://liav.shinyapps.io/kmeans_pca/

You can learn from this project:
1. How to build a K-Means Algorithm from scratch in R.
2. How to create a shiny app and show your results interactivly.
3. How similar are tissues by their genes structure.
